    <h1>About League </h1>
    <p>
        League of Legends (kurz: LoL oder nur League) ist ein vom US-amerikanischen Riot Games entwickeltes und
        betriebenes Multiplayer-Online-Battle-Arena-Computerspiel (MOBA), das am 27. Oktober 2009 für Windows und macOS
        veröffentlicht wurde.

        Es erschien als Free-to-play-Titel und wurde zeitweise von etwa 100 Millionen Spielern monatlich gespielt.[1]

        Jeder Spieler steuert eine Spielfigur aus der Vogelperspektive über das quadratische Spielfeld und versucht die
        eigene Hälfte des Spielfelds zu verteidigen.

        Das Spielprinzip ist von Defense of the Ancients, einer Mod für Warcraft III, inspiriert. Im klassischen
        Spielmodus von League of Legends treten zwei Teams aus je fünf Spielern gegeneinander an. Ziel des Spiels ist
        die Zerstörung der gegnerischen Basis in der der eigenen Basis gegenüberliegenden Ecke des Spielfelds. Innerhalb
        eines etwa 20- bis 50-minütigen Spiels gewinnen die Spielfiguren stetig an Stärke und Ausrüstung dazu.

        League of Legends ist eine beliebte Disziplin im E-Sport. Mit einer internationalen Fan- und Spielerszene sowie
        zwölf Dachligen und zahlreichen Regionalligen wird das Spiel regelmäßig als weltweit größter E-Sport bezeichnet.
        Turniere, wie die jährlich stattfindende League of Legends World Championship, wurden teilweise von über 100
        Millionen Zuschauern verfolgt.

            <img src="res/Champions/League_Infobox_Qiyana.jpg" alt="Pic of Qiyana">
            <p> Im Dschungel von Ixaocan schmiedet Qiyana einen skrupellosen Plan, um den Thron der Yun Tal zu
                besteigen.
                Die Letzte in der Thronfolge tritt jedem, der sich ihr in den Weg stellt, mit dreistem Selbstbewusstsein
                und
                beispielloser Beherrschung der Elementarmagie entgegen. Qiyana hält sich für das größte Elementartalent
                in
                der Geschichte von Ixaocan. Da sogar das Land selbst jedem ihrer Befehle gehorcht, ist sie der Ansicht,
                dass
                ihr nicht nur die Herrschaft über eine Stadt, sondern über ein ganzes Kaiserreich zusteht.</p>

        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/League_Infobox_Akali.jpg" alt="Pic of Akali">
            <p>Abandoning the Kinkou Order and her title of the Fist of Shadow, Akali now strikes alone, ready to be the
                deadly weapon her people need. Though she holds onto all she learned from her master Shen, she has
                pledged
                to defend Ionia from its enemies, one kill at a time. Akali may strike in silence, but her message will
                be
                heard loud and clear: fear the assassin with no master.

                Ionia has always been a land of wild magic, its vibrant people and powerful spirits seeking to live in
                harmony… but sometimes this peaceful equilibrium does not come easily. Sometimes it needs to be kept in
                check.</p>

        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/League_Infobox_Fizz.jpg">
            <p>Fizz is an amphibious yordle, who dwells among the reefs surrounding Bilgewater. He often retrieves and
                returns the tithes cast into the sea by superstitious captains, but even the saltiest of sailors know
                better
                than to cross him—for many are the tales of those who have underestimated this slippery character. Often
                mistaken for some manner of capricious ocean spirit, he seems able to command the beasts of the deep,
                and
                delights in confounding his allies and enemies alike.</p>

        <h2>Kha'Zix</h2>
        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/League_Infobox_Kha'Zix.jpg">
            <p>The Void grows, and the Void adapts—in none of its myriad spawn are these truths more apparent than
                Kha’Zix.
                Evolution drives the core of this mutating horror, born to survive and to slay the strong. Where it
                struggles to do so, it grows new, more effective ways to counter and kill its prey. Initially a mindless
                beast, Kha’Zix’s intelligence has developed as much as its form. Now, the creature plans out its hunts,
                and
                even utilizes the visceral terror it engenders in its victims.</p>

        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/League_Infobox_Rek'Sai.jpg">
            <p>An apex predator, Rek’Sai is a merciless Void-spawn that tunnels beneath the ground to ambush and devour
                unsuspecting prey. Her insatiable hunger has laid waste to entire regions of the once-great empire of
                Shurima—merchants, traders, even armed caravans, will go hundreds of miles out of their way to avoid her
                and
                her offspring’s hunting grounds. All know that once Rek’Sai is seen on the horizon, death from below is
                all
                but guaranteed.</p>

        <h2>Warwick</h2>
        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/League_Infobox_Warwick.jpg">
            <p>Warwick is a monster who hunts the gray alleys of Zaun. Transformed by agonizing experiments, his body is
                fused with an intricate system of chambers and pumps, machinery filling his veins with alchemical rage.
                Bursting out of the shadows, he preys upon those criminals who terrorize the city’s depths. Warwick is
                drawn to blood, and driven mad by its scent. None who spill it can escape him.</p>

        <h2>Olaf</h2>
        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/League_Infobox_Olaf.jpg">
            <p>An unstoppable force of destruction, the axe-wielding Olaf wants nothing but to die in glorious combat.
                Hailing from the brutal Freljordian peninsula of Lokfar, he once received a prophecy foretelling his
                peaceful passing—a coward's fate, and a great insult among his people. Seeking death, and fueled by
                rage, he rampaged across the land, slaughtering scores of great warriors and legendary beasts in search
                of any opponent who could stop him. Now a brutal enforcer for the Winter's Claw, he seeks his end in the
                great wars to come.</p>

        <h2>Diana</h2>
        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/League_Infobox_Diana.jpg">
            <p>Bearing her crescent moonblade and clad in shimmering armor the color of winter snow at night, Diana is a
                living embodiment of the silver moon’s power. Imbued with the essence of an Aspect from beyond Targon’s
                towering summit, Diana is no longer wholly human, and struggles to understand her power and purpose in
                this world.

                Diana did not belong on Mount Targon. </p>

        <h2>Hecarim</h2>
        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/League_Infobox_Hecarim.jpg">
            <p>Hecarim is a spectral fusion of man and beast, cursed to ride down the souls of the living for all
                eternity. When the Blessed Isles fell into shadow, this proud knight was undone by the destructive
                energies of the Ruination, along with all his cavalry and their mounts. Now, whenever the Black Mist
                reaches out across Runeterra, he leads their devastating charge, reveling in the slaughter and crushing
                foes beneath his armored hooves.

                Born into an empire long since gone to dust and forgotten, Hecarim was a lieutenant of the Iron Order—a
                brotherhood sworn to defend their king’s lands.

        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/Lulu_Original.jpg">
            <p>The yordle mage Lulu is known for conjuring dreamlike illusions and fanciful creatures as she roams
                Runeterra with her fairy companion Pix. Lulu shapes reality on a whim, warping the fabric of the world,
                and what she views as the constraints of this mundane, physical realm. While others might consider her
                magic at best unnatural, and at worst dangerous, she believes everyone could use a touch of enchantment.

        <h2>Janna</h2>
        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/Janna_Original.jpg">
            <p>An ancient and mysterious wind spirit, Janna has come to protect the dispossessed of Zaun. While her
                presence is most often felt as a soothing breeze or a ferocious tempest, she also can manifest in
                corporeal form as an ethereal figure, comforting the downtrodden. Over the eons, Janna has witnessed the
                rise and fall of civilizations. Through it all, she remains steadfast as a beacon of hope to those in
                need.

                Since ancient times, there have been those who prayed to the winds. From sailors seeking good weather to
                the downtrodden calling on winds of change, mortals have placed their hope in the tempests and gales
                that sweep across Runeterra.

                Surprisingly, the wind sometimes would seem to answer. Seafarers might spot a bright blue bird just
                before a healthy tailwind billowed their sails. Others could swear they’d heard a whistling in the air
                right before a storm, as if to warn them of its approach. As word of these omens spread, sightings of
                the bird grew more common. Some even swore they had seen the bird transform into a woman. With tapered
                ears and flowing hair, this mysterious maiden was said to float above the water and direct the wind with
                a flick of her staff.

                The faithful called this wind spirit Jan’ahrem, an ancient Shuriman word meaning “guardian,” for she
                always seemed to appear in moments of great need. As time went on, she came to be known more simply as
                Janna.

        <h2>Karma</h2>
        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/League_Infobox_Karma.jpg">
            <p>No mortal exemplifies the spiritual traditions of Ionia more than Karma. She is the living embodiment of
                an ancient soul reincarnated countless times, carrying all her accumulated memories into each new life,
                and blessed with power that few can comprehend. She has done her best to guide her people in recent
                times of crisis, though she knows that peace and harmony may come only at a considerable cost—both to
                her, and to the land she holds most dear.

                Karma is the living embodiment of an ancient Ionian soul, who serves as a spiritual beacon to each
                generation of her people. Her most recent incarnation came in the form of a 12-year-old girl named
                Darha. Raised in the northern highlands of Shon-Xan, she was headstrong and independent, always dreaming
                of a life beyond her provincial village.

                But Darha began to suffer strange, fitful visions. The images were curious—they felt like memories, yet
                the girl was certain they had not happened to her. At first, the problem was easy enough to conceal, but
                the visions grew in intensity until Darha was convinced she was descending into madness.

        <h2>Seraphine</h2>
        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/Seraphine.jpg">
            <p>Born in Piltover to Zaunite parents, Seraphine can hear the souls of others—the world sings to her, and
                she sings back. Though these sounds overwhelmed her in her youth, she now draws on them for inspiration,
                turning the chaos into a symphony. She performs for the sister cities to remind their citizens that
                they’re not alone, that they’re stronger together, and that, in her eyes, their potential is limitless.

                In Piltover, where anyone’s dream can become everyone’s progress, a star is born.

                As a child, Seraphine always loved music, especially her father’s lullabies. The songs were beautiful,
                but sad. He’d brought them up to Piltover as he and Seraphine’s mother—two lifelong Zaunites—sought a
                better life in the City of Progress.

                Leaning out the window of their hexcoustics workshop, where broken sound tech was made to play again,
                Seraphine sang along with the streets. The shanties of the Sun Gates, the whistling of apprentices, even
                the melody of conversation—in a bustling city like Piltover, she was never alone.

        <h2>Sona</h2>
        <div class="char">
            <img src="res/Champions/Sona_Original.jpg">
            <p>Sona is a virtuoso of the stringed etwahl, speaking only through her graceful chords and vibrant arias.
                Her genteel manner has endeared her to the Demacian nobility, though some speculate her arresting
                melodies actually emanate magic—a dangerous prospect in the kingdom. Silent to outsiders but understood
                easily enough by close companions, Sona plucks her harmonies not only to soothe injured allies, but also
                to strike down unsuspecting enemies.

                Sona’s earliest memories are of the Ionian monastery where she was raised, in the province of Galrin.
                The monks, along with kindhearted volunteers from the local villages, took in any orphans or foundlings
                left at the front gates, and made sure that they would want for nothing.

                As a young girl, Sona was considered shy and quiet, until it became apparent that she couldn’t speak at
                all. But she was unusually thoughtful and attentive, and the other children tended to seek her out
                whenever they needed comfort, their playful smiles quickly restored.
